Who is there to worry about you now
If there's a body in your heart to give
And there's a world outside of you now, and you gotta let it live
So if you never, ever let it run, I'll never chain you to my life
'Cos I believe you gotta leave your worries behind

You know you worry so bad, I never thought that it could hurt me
And if you ever imagine why, I never thought again about me
It seems it only happens when you're feeling good
Come and gimme, gimme love until the light shines again

Come and gimme love and let the sun to live
Come and gimme, gimme love until you choose my life
Never, never gonna let you worry again my love

Oh my feelings, don't mess my world my time of day again
Don't discard my friends, this world seems to break 'em
But again it's something left alone we'll find a way to
Let it come so true
If you can do, when you know your love is overdue

If I was to let you go out and get it
You know your work would be just fine
You want to give a lotta when you gonna get it
You never let it come
Between you in your mind
Never talk, talk, talk about
You'll always be a friend of mine
You're gonna let this sunbeam happen, happen to you

Come and gimme gimme gimme love until the light shines again
Come and gimme gimme love right from you
Come and gimme gimme love until I lose my pain
Come and gimme gimme love I believe in you
Everybody
Come come and gimme love and let the light shine through
Come come and gimme love just from you, just from you
Yeah, yeah...
