Love, love, love
I'm looking for love
Love, love, love

When I was only sixteen
Well, give it take a year or more
I've got to singing about
The life I've lead
And I threw it right out of the door

I've got to get some of
That heavy jive
That the old folks are talkin' about
So I strutted my stuff
To the local club
To see what I was leaving now

Looking for love, love, love
Looking, looking for love
Love, love, love

I took my seat at
The foot of the stage
And waited for the fun to begin
And there in the light

Stood this heavy chick
With the cutest babe
That I've ever seen

She smiled at me
She did her dance
Took me by surprise
The way she wiggled her hips
And she shook that ...
Right between the eyes

After the show she came
And sat down
Said: hi son, what's your name?
I said: never mind that
Think about this:
Loving's the name of my game

She said: that's alright
But it'll cost you, son
I said: tell me what's
The price of the day
She said: twenty dime
And a wedding ring
And everything will be o.k.
