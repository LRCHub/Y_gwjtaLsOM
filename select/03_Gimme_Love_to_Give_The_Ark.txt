Gimme love, gimme love
Gimme love to give to others
Gimme strength to endure
When I'm fed up with this world
Gimme love, gimme love
Gimme love to give to others
Gimme strength to endure when I simply hate this world

Oh, it's a pretty idea
Walk this world like a messiah
But it will bring you to tears
And people will call you a liar
And when the scorners in the corner
Spread their anguish every morning
I just wish that there's a God that can hear me:

Gimme love, gimme love
Gimme love to give to others
Gimme strength to endure
When I'm fed up with this world
Gimme love, gimme love
Gimme love to give to others
Gimme strength to endure when I simply hate this world

When people passing you by
You'll always been a child in yearning
You say that you will get by
But the sadness in your heart is burning
And here comes Chuck
He says: Lend me a buck
Next thing you're lying on sidewalk bleeding

Gimme love, gimme love
Gimme love to give to others
Gimme strength to endure
When I'm fed up with this world
Gimme love, gimme love
Gimme love to give to others
Gimme strength to endure when I only hate this world

Oh Lord I need your help now
To feel love 'cause I've forgotten how
And it's so hard you see when
All the scrutinizers, brutalizers
Hipster jerks and bad advisors
Make my ears and eyes bleed
Please!
Oh Lord!

Gimme love, gimme love
Gimme love to give to others
Gimme strength to endure
When I'm fed up with this world
Gimme love, gimme love
Gimme love to give to others
Gimme strength to endure when I only hate this world
Gimme love ooh Gimme love to give
Gimme love ooh Gimme love to give
When I simply hate this world
Say will my prayer be heard?
