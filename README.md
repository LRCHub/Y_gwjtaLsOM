[00:05.18] Yo, this Channel Tres (Gimme, gimme love, gimme, gimme love)
[00:07.64] (When I'm gone, when I'm gone) Love, yeah
[00:28.14] 
[00:16.39] Swing around front, let me inside
[00:20.02] Playin' my song into my sides
[00:23.94] It hurts, I can't lie
[00:25.88] Remember those times I fought to get out?
[00:29.95] I want to get out
[00:32.03] Those pictures so clear (Yeah), they fade in my mind ([?])
[00:36.23] You leavin' me here with ashes and fire
[00:40.19] These people don't heal, these people don't feel (You can't really feel it)
[00:45.55] These people aren't real, so make me this deal
[00:48.35] Won't you?
[00:53.35] 
[00:48.87] Gimme, gimme love, gimme, gimme love
[00:52.72] Gimme, gimme love, gimme, gimme love
[00:56.31] When I'm gone (Gone), when I'm gone (One more time, Joji)
[01:05.32] Gimme, gimme love, gimme, gimme love
[01:09.04] Gimme, gimme love, gimme, gimme love
[01:12.56] When I'm gone (Gone), when I'm gone
[01:30.06] 
[01:21.92] Swing around front, let me inside
[01:25.02] Playin' my song into my sides (I'm lookin' for someone to hold)
[01:29.03] It hurts, I can't lie
[01:30.91] (Remember those) Remember those times I fought to get out? (Times)
[01:37.07] Those pictures so clear, they fade in my mind
[01:41.12] You leavin' me here with ashes and fire (Leavin' me in tears)
[01:45.23] These people don't heal, these people don't feel
[01:49.33] These people aren't real, so make me this deal
[01:53.48] Won't you?
[01:58.48] 
[01:53.95] Gimme, love
[01:56.09] Love when I'm gone (Love for me)
[02:00.64] When I'm gone (What do I do? What do I do? I wonder about you)
[02:10.59] Gimme, love (How you feelin')
[02:15.87] Love when I'm gone (How was your day?)
[02:20.08] When I'm gone (I feel, ah, ah)
[02:26.48] Gimme (Gimme love), love (Gimme love)
[02:32.00] Love when I'm gone
[02:36.44] When I'm gone (You said, "When I'm gone")
[02:40.87] (I already know you tryin' this too late, I know you hate to move it along)
[02:44.56] Gimme, love
[02:46.86] Love when I'm gone (Channel Tres, special)
[02:50.91] Gimme, love
[02:56.44] Love when I'm gone
[03:00.82] When I'm gone
